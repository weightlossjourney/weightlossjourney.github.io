    <h3><U>Next Big Goal Reached</U></h3>

    <br>

    <p>I finally reached my next big goal. Under 300 pounds. As of this morning I am at 299.8 pounds which puts me 115 pounds lost since the beginning of this journey.</p>

    <p>I honestly cannot remember the last time I weighed less than 300 pounds. Never the less I am extremely happy with were I am at currently. It took a while to lose those last five pounds. I got really close a couple of times but my weight would fluctuate and I would put more weight back on just before reaching 300. But this morning at weigh in I was finally there at 299.8 pounds.</p>

    <p>250 here I come. It may take a while but I will get there eventually. 8-) </p>

    <h3><U>Another Short Update</U></h3>

    <br>

    <p>Once again not a whole lot to talk about today. Still trying to maintain my diet and keep the weight loss going no matter how much it has slowed down. As of this morning I weighed in at 304 pounds. Which equals to 111 pounds lost from the beginning of this journey. I am really wanting those next 4 pounds as it will put me under 300 and that is a huge milestone for me.</p>

    <p>Other than this, I am also currently fighting the urge to upgrade my PC. I don't really need to but want to and you know how that goes. When you want something bad enough you will find a reason to get it.</p>

    <h3><U>Short Update</U></h3>

    <br>

    <p>Not a whole lot to talk about today. Still trying to maintain my diet. Good new is that as of today I weight 310 pounds. Which equals to 105 pounds lost from the beginning of this journey. I honestly do not remember the last time I weighed in at 310 pounds.</p>

    <p>Any way. As of today I am on vacation from work. Or I guess I could be more accurate and say stay-cation. Not going anywhere or doing anything special. Just staying home this week and relaxing and playing a few games on the computer.</p>

    <h3><U>100 POUNDS DOWN</U></h3>

    <br>

    <p>Today I hit another big goal. One I never thought I would see again in my lifetime. As of this morning I am 100 pounds down from the beginning of my journey. When I started this I was 415 pounds and this morning I weighed in at 314.8.</p>

    <p>I have set my next goal at 299.9 pounds to get me under 300. I honestly don't remember what age I was when I was last under 300 pounds but I do know it was a really long time ago.</p>

    <p>Today is a really good day. 8-)</p>

    <h3><U>Bariatric Surgery and Kidney Stones</U></h3>

    <br>

    <p>While I have heard a lot of horror stories, personally I have never in my life suffered from kidney stones. Until this month...</p>

    <p>I know some studies show that people that have had bariatric surgery are at a higher risk of developing kidney stones. However with so many other things to focus on the warning fell to the back of my mind never to be heard from again until this month.</p>

    <p>I was relaxing at home one weekend when I started to develop a slight discomfort in my right groin. Within a matter of minutes it had moved up around my belt line and became excruciating. For two hours I walked the floor. The pain so bad I was unable to sit, walk or lay down for any length of time. Then as quickly as it started it went away.</p>

    <p>I made an appointment with my doctor for later in the week and explained what happened. While he agreed with me that it sounded like kidney stones he offered no hints or ideas on how to prevent them from happening again. He took blood and urine sample said he would send them off for testing and I never heard from him again about it.</p>

    <p>A week or so later I was asleep on a Tuesday night when I awoke in the night with another slight pain but this time in my left groin. Within minutes I was pacing the floor. After two hours of this I woke my dad and told him to drive me to the emergency room. I arrived at the emergency room and checked in with the counter and started pacing. I have been here before and had to wait several hours before they could get to me but they called me back in less that five minutes.</p>

    <p>I explained to the doctor what happened and the first words out of his mouth was "Kidney Stones". He could tell I was hurting as I was covered in sweat and my blood pressure was way too high. He stepped out and a few minutes later a nurse came in with a needle and shot me up. Turns out it was Morphine. Let me say I can easily understand how someone could become addicted to the stuff. The pain levels immediately dropped to a more manageable level and I asked the nurse to marry me. She laugh and told me she gets asked that a lot.</p>

    <p>After some time I was taken and given a CT scan and was told that I do have kidney Stone and a lot of them. However they were all small enough that the doctor felt there would be no need to perform any kind of procedure as most of them would break down into sand I would never notice as they left the body. He gave me two prescriptions one for pain if I have another attack and one for antibiotics.</P>

    <p> I left the hospital around dawn and while I was still sore and in some minor pain it was nowhere near the levels that caused me to go there in the first place. I am still sore several days later but have not had another attack. Let me say this stuff hurts. It hurts in a way I would never wish on anyone and I really hope you never have to go through it.</p>

    <p>If you are considering bariatric surgery for weight loss remember that you may be at a higher risk for kidney stones. Make sure you stay up on your fluid intake and talk with your doctor about it. Especially if you have a history of developing them already.</p>

    <p>I would also recommend you read the information provided at the following <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355759">--> link <--.</a></p>

    <h3><U>Fitbit Aria 2 Scale</U></h3>

    <br>

    <p>Back on May 30th I finally reach a weight milestone that would allow me to buy a normal scale. Before this I was too heavy for most scales to work properly and had to use a scale designed for overweight people.</p>

    <p>I had my eye on the <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Aria-Wi-Fi-Smart-Scale/dp/B0752M6T6K/ref=sr_1_4_s_it?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1530718983&sr=1-4&keywords=aria+scale target="_blank">Fitbit Aria 2 Scale</a> for sometime. What I liked about it was that once it was setup it connected to the app through my cell phone and kept track of not only my weight but my body fat index.</p>

    <p>Now I wont lie. This thing was a bear to get setup. It would not see my WiFi through my current PC setup. It would not see my cell phone nor would it see my laptop WiFi either.</p>

    <p>I spent the better part of two hours reading forums and Google articles trying to find a fix for this very common issue. Every where I looked I found complaint after complaint about this very same problem. There were a lot of suggestions for fixes but to be honest they were far beyond the technical skill of the majority of people including myself.</p>

    <p>I had one last idea and if it did not work I was going to return it for a refund. I had remembered I have an older tablet I keep for emergency use. If I do something to my computer (which I frequently do) and need another way to access the net to look up fixes I had my tablet. I had not thought about it in a while as I also bought a laptop somewhere in between there. So I pulled out the tablet and downloaded the app and it connected fine. So now I have a working scale that connects to my app and tracks everything for me automatically.</p>

    <p>Now that I have gotten past the setup issues I love this scale. I am just dreading if I ever have to get this thing connected to my app again. It was a lot of hassle the first time.</p>

    <h3><U>Medical Bills</U></h3>

    <br>

    <p>With my surgery being a little over six weeks ago I am starting to get invoices from the insurance company on what bills have been submitted and paid for and what I am still responsible for paying.</p>

    <p>So far it has been at what I expected but I did receive a little surprise this past Monday in the mail. It was a statement from the insurance in regards to the anesthesiologist. The bill itself was kinda shocking because if this is what they charge I am in the wrong business.</p>

    <p>The statement showed the billed amount, how much was covered by insurance, (In this case zero dollars), and how much I was responsible for. The bill was $5,000 US and insurance was going to cover zero dollars and I would be responsible for the full amount of $5,000 dollars.</p>

    <p>The first question that came to mind was what did he give me that was worth $5,000 dollars? Especially as the surgery was only about an hour long.</p>

    <p>The second question was why did insurance deny covering any part of that bill? Did they think that anesthesia was unnecessary?</p>

    <p>It was too late in the afternoon to call as they were already closed for the day so I took the bill with me to work the next day and called my insurance company to see if I could get an answer. I was betting that is was a mistake, as most times insurance refuses to pay it is on something they feel is unnecessary for the procedure in question.</p>

    <p>I called and spoke with Kelly who was very helpful and she was just as confused as I as to why it was not paid. Her records show the invoice was received but the computer billing system rejected it and assigned me 100% responsibility on that bill.</p>

    <p>She admitted it had to be some kind of mistake and resubmitted the bill for review and overrode the automated computer rejection and said I would get a new statement in 7 to 10 business days. She was unable to tell me if the bill would be rejected again or how much would be covered by insurance.</p>

    <p>Take this to heart folks. While I am still waiting on the final judgment on this bill, when you have any procedure done that will be billed to insurance please pay close attention to all your statements and if something looks wrong or strange don't hesitate to give someone a call.</p>

    <p>If you do so and remain calm and polite they will do the same and many times will work to help you out. Not every company is out to screw you over but, always write down names, times and what was discussed and you can go a long way in getting things resolved with as little stress as possible.</p>

    <p>I still want to know what he did that was worth 5 grand for an hours worth of work though.</p>

    <h3><U>Am I becoming too critical of others?</U></h3>

    <br>

    <p>I have noticed something about myself that has me a little worried and feeling some what hypocritical.</p>

    <p>Recently I have caught myself noticing others that are obese or doing or eating something that is bad for them and thinking that they aren't even trying to do right.</p>

    <p>I have even come close a couple of times to saying something only to catch myself at the last minute. I fully understand that their weight or bad habit is none of my business or concern. I do not know their issues, concerns or any struggles they have been or are currently going through. I also know that I myself would not care to listen to people interfering in my life or weight struggles and the only person I can say anything about is myself. Even then, while I have lost a lot of weight, I still have a long way to go and am still obese by any definition of the word you want to try an use.</p>

    <p>I have been a strong supporter all my life of the mind your own business philosophy and cannot understand why now, I am looking at others and judging them because of their weight.</p>

    <p>I am working hard on my weight issues and am willing to talk about my journey and experience to anyone that wants to discuss it but have been reminding myself that other people have a right to not to have to listen to me as well.</p>

    <p>So if you want to talk about weight loss surgery or ask me any questions regarding this journey I am on feel free to ask me anything. However if you are sick of people talking about loosing weight and don't want to hear it. That is good as well and we can talk about other things too.</p>

    <p>So.... Anyone been fishing lately?  ;-)</p>

    <h3><U>The best meal you ever ate?</U></h3>

    <br>

    <p>If you were asked "What is the best meal you ever ate?" what would you say? Was it a steak at a five star restaurant, your famous BBQ or your mom's secret recipe? Let me tell you about the best meal I ever ate and it was just 10 minutes ago. Today is the day my Bariatric Doctor told me I could break my liquid diet and move onto soft solids.</p>

    <p>Now I knew this was a special occasion and I looked at several forums, watched videos on You Tube and even posted some questions to my Bypass Support Group. What was your first meal when moving onto soft solids? The answer with an over whelming majority was scrambled eggs. I decided to follow tradition and keep it safe so I had a single scrambled egg.</p>

    <p>And Lord was it delicious! I cannot believe how something so simple as a scrambled egg could taste so good. A single egg scrambled in a buttered skillet with just a touch of salt and pepper as the only spices and nothing else. That first bite was amazing and I ate as slow as I could to savor the taste and texture.</p>

    <p>Now I am sure you are scoffing or laughing at me but I challenge you to go 5 weeks on nothing but liquid. Then have your first solid food and not be amazed at how good it tastes.</p>

    <p>Like I said I received several suggestions but the over whelming majority was for the simple scrambled egg and man am I glad I decided to follow the majority this time. I will never look at the egg them same way again.</p>

    <p>Some of the other foods mentions were </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Soups</li>

      <li>Canned Tuna</li>

      <li>Chili (Wendy's)</li>

      <li>Egg, Tuna or Ham Salad</li>

    <h3><U>One week follow up</U></h3>

    <br>

    <p>As of this morning I am at 337 pounds which puts me down 78 pounds from the start of this journey.</p>

    <p>Last Friday the 25th I had my one week follow with the bariatric surgeon. I got there and got weighed in and the nurse seemed to be impressed with the weight lost since I started the program. She asked me the same old questions, How is my pain? Am I getting my fluid intake in? Am I getting my walking in? Those kind of questions.</p>

    <p>After speaking with her I was placed in a room to wait on the doctor. While waiting I noticed an height weight chart on the wall and got to looking at it. Apparently at 6'4 my ideal weight is 185 according to the chart. I just can't imagine myself at 185 pounds, it would seem anorexic.</p>

    <p>Anyway the doctor came in and was looking over my stats and straight away told me she was not interested in weight loss at this time. She would be more interested in it at my next visit is 4 - 6 weeks. She started in on the same questions as the nurse. Am I getting my fluids in? Am I getting my walks in? How is the pain levels?</p>

    <p>I replied yes to her questions and the pain was low to non existent. I have not taken any meds for pain since the first night home. I was not in any real pain then but they help me sleep.</p>

    <p>She was happy with the answers and then asked to see the incision wounds on my stomach and said they look to be doing good as well. She told me I could start soft foods in a week and could go back to normal physical activity in a month. Set me up for another visit in 6 weeks and sent me on my way.</p>

    <p>It seems I am one of the really lucky ones. If it was not for the fact I have the scars to prove it I would doubt I even had the surgery if I were to compare myself to all the horror stories I have heard going into this. </p>

    <p>Little to no pain, able to urinate like normal, no gas or air build up. Also I am a stomach sleeper and by the fourth night I was back to sleeping on my stomach with no discomfort. All in all I got really lucky.</p>

    <h3><U>Returned home from the hospital</U></h3>

    <br>

    <p>Well. I went to the hospital Thursday the 17th at 5 am. Got checked in and sent to the surgical floor where a nurse had me undress and put on a hospital gown. I was then hooked up to an IV and saline and answered a bunch of questions about my diet, physical and mental health.</p>

    <p>After the nurse was done with her duties the anesthesiologist came in and explained what he was going to do and any possibilities that arise with a procedure of this type. After he completed his spiel two orderlies came and and wheeled me to the surgical room. And that the last thing I remember before waking up in my room.</p>

    <p>I remember waking up and it was around 9:30 am. I was alone in my room and just closed my eyes and went right back to sleep. I dosed off and on for the rest of the day. The nurse assigned to me came in and woke me a couple of times to check my vitals but other than that let me sleep.</p>

    <p>When shift change came the day nurse came and introduced the night shift nurse to me. The second nurse asked me if I had urinated yet. I told her no but if they would unhook me from the bed I really had to go bad right then and there.</p>

    <p>After using the facilities the nurse told me it was a good thing I did because if I hadn't she was going to have to put a catheter in me. Around midnight I had to page the nurse to came and unhook me from the wall as I really needed to go to the restroom again.</p>

    <p>When I was finished she asked me if I feel up to a walk. I told we can walk at anytime so we took a walk around the floor past the nurses station and doubled back past the elevators.</p>

    <p>This repeated itself for the rest of the night and the following day. The nurse kept reloading the saline and I kept going back and forth between the restroom, walking the hallways and sipping water. If I was not doing one of these then I was dozing.</p>

    <p>The Doctor came and visited me at noon and after a discussion told me I was good enough to go home.She left to process the release paperwork and at about 3:00 a nurse came in and unhooked me from the IV and let me get dressed. I called my ride to come get me and I was gone from the hospital.</p>

    <p>I made it home from the hospital around 4:00 and was really nauseated from the car trip. I didn't do anything really once I returned home. Just sat and relaxed while sipping on water. I have to be very careful on how much I drink and I have to log every drink I take. I need to drink 64 oz a day which is really going to be tough. I was not able to get it all down at the hospital nor was I able to do so I home. I am hoping today I can get more down.</p>

    <h3><U>Insurance Approval Received</U></h3>

    <br>

    <p>Good news, my surgery has been approved by insurance with a scheduled date of 05/17/2018. As of today, I have been on the liquid diet since 04/30/18 and have dropped several pounds. This morning I weighed in at 354.5 lbs. putting me at 61 lbs. down since the beginning. I have been doing 4 Premier Protein shakes a day with a condensed soup for dinner. It hasn’t been too bad but there are times when all I can think about is real food. When that happens, I try to get my mind on something else. Usually I read or watch a video on YouTube or play a game. When it happens at work I put on the iPod to distract myself.</p>

    <p>I must do a liquid diet of two weeks before and two weeks after the surgery. So, I have been stocking up on the Premier Protein, condensed soups and clear protein drinks. The day before surgery I can only have clear liquids to include clear protein drinks, water, decaf tea, sugar free popsicles, crystal light and broth.</p>

    <p>Weeks 3 through 6 I can have soft solid foods. The must be moist and mushy, and I will have to chew them to a liquid consistency before swallowing. (Sounds yummy doesn’t it? Bleh…)</p>

    <p>Soft food includes: ¼ - ½ cup of well cooked beans or legumes. 1 to 2 ounces of low fat cheese such as string cheese. 1 egg scrambled or poached. ¼ - ½ cup of tuna, egg, chicken or ham salad.</p>

    <p>After 6 weeks I move back to solid foods. I must then follow a lifetime eating plan of high protein, low fat and low sugar. So, when eating I will need to eat in order of meats and proteins first, then vegetables then fruits then starches.

    There are a whole host of directions and suggestions to follow that it would take far too long to write them here, but this is the basics of the instructions I will need to follow.</P>

    <p>My initial goal was to lose 165lbs to put me at 250. I have already lost 61 of those pounds so I really only need to lose another 104 more pounds to reach my initial goal. The government and the doctor say at my height I should weight between 190 and 220. The 250 is my initial goal but my stretch goal is 220lbs.</p>

    <p>As an incentive I have promised myself that if I reach the 250 goal I will buy myself something I have always wanted but could not have due to my size and that is a Kayak. I love fishing but do not want to buy a boat and a Kayak is a nice compromise. I don’t know yet what I will do for a reward if I reach my stretch goal but will keep my eyes open and we will see what pops up.</p>

  <h3><u>6 Month Commitment Complete</u></h3>

  <br>

  <p>It has been over a month since I have added anything but honestly, little has happened that needed to be documented. However now I have finished my 6 month dietitian visits as required by insurance and have also met with the bariatric surgeon for my final visit before surgery.</p>

  <p>On my last visit with the dietitian I had to attend a final class on the surgery. It was almost identical to the first class. As a matter of fact the class was mostly people who are just beginning their journey, so the class was targeted mostly to them.</p>

  <p>After that class then I had to schedule a visit with the bariatric surgeon where we went over and signed a surgery release. You know those documents that say the doctor has told you all the scary and horrible things that can go wrong.</p>

  <p>The doctors office has submitted the final paperwork to the insurance company and we are just waiting for approval for surgery. They are so confident of approval they have already set a date. May 17th.</p>

  <p>So as of yesterday I have started the two week liquid diet program. This is to cause my liver to shrink so it is not in the way when surgery is performed. I have heard stories, from the doctor no less, of people that have been taken into surgery and cut into only for the doctor to find the liver has not shrunk and the doctor stopped the surgery.</p>

  <p>There are many little things that I bought to help out along the way. First and foremost I bought a container that I can carry easily that is 64oz. We are instructed to drink 64oz of liquid a day. I have been keeping track of the glasses I drink but came across a container the other day that was perfect. It is also recommended we buy a smaller plate, bowl, fork, spoon and knife to help us get used to eating smaller portions per bite, so I purchased those as well.</p>

  <p>At this point I think I am as ready as am going to be. It has been 6 months on this journey so far and many more years to go but I am ready to move onto the next leg. Surgery and beyond.</p>

  <h3><u>Unhelpful Comments</u></h3>

  <br>

  <p>It amazes me how many people feel qualified to offer advice and comments when they find out you are going to have or may already have had weight loss surgery. Some of the ones I am getting lately are…</p>
  
   <ul>
      <li>You’re taking the easy way out.</li>

      <li>Just diet you can lose the weight if you really wanted to.</li>

      <li>You just need to join a gym.</li>

      <li>Take up running.</li>

      <li>Jenny Craig can help you lose the weight and it won’t cost as much money.</li>

      <li>Everyone who has the surgery just ends up putting the weight back on.</li>

      <li>You’re going to regret doing it down the road.</li>
    </ul>

 

  <p>On and on the comments go. Never really offering any true help and not knowing you have already tried most if not all of these suggestions long before you decided to get the surgery.</p>

 

<p>For many people surgery was not the first option but their last chance to get rid of the extra pounds. It’s not like we are trying to lose 5 or 10 pounds. For many like myself, we are trying to drop 100 pounds or more. We have tried many different diets, joined gyms and tried everything we came across in this endeavor. Maybe in the short term we lost some weight and a few even lost a lot of weight but long term it did not work out.</p>

<p>You may call it being weak willed or not having the strength to stick it out or any of a hundred other excuses but for many of us surgery was the final and best option. Please think before you start offering advice no one asked for. You don’t know what that person has tried before reaching this point.</p>

  <h3><u>Quick Update</u></h3>

  <br>

  <p>Just wanted to give everyone a quick update as I have not posted in a couple of weeks. Weight wise I have not lost anymore nor have I gained. This is to be expected and I am not really expecting to loose much more until I start a liquid diet phase before surgery.</p>

  <p>I have two more visits with the dietitian before I see the Bariatric doctor again. Then a date will be set for surgery.</p>

  <p>My time for the last two weeks has been spent working on this web page. Cleaning up some coding and making some changes. It was a multi page website but I have taken it down to just one. I will continue to work on it and will be adding and subtracting things as I lean how to do so. I am using this as a learning experience so expect this website to be in constant flux. Don't expect too much from the beginning as I am coding everything from scratch. Since I am not working from a template it will not be as polished as a site done by a professional or using a template.</p>

  <p>Lately I have been hearing a lot about zero calorie or negative calorie foods. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative-calorie_food" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> defines Negative Calorie foods as food that requires more energy to digest than the food provides. It's thermic effect or the caloric cost of digesting the food would be greater than its food energy content.</p>

  <p>Despite its popularity I have been unable to find a scientific study reporting that any food is calorically negative. (I am not a scientist nor a trained researcher so I may be completely wrong). There are a number of foods however that have been shown to be low calorie foods. Below is a small list I was able to find doing a search on the internet. Some of which I have incorporated into my diet as foods of choice.</p>

  <p>Remember this is by no means an exhaustive list and even if considered low calorie, moderation is the key here. Too much of anything is bad for you so consider what you are eating and the quantity.</p>

  <h3><u>1st big goal achieved</u></h3>

  <br>

  <p>It's been about two weeks since my last entry but that is because things have been slow, weight wise and real life has a way of messing up any plans you may have.</p>

  <p>But today I have great news. When I weighed myself I met and passed my first big goal for myself. I set many small goals but my first big on was to reach 50 lbs lost. Today when I weighed myself I was down 51 lbs.</p>

  <p>I felt that setting small achievable goals was the way to go but I also like to set larger goals that give me something to stretch for. My smaller goals were in 5 lb increments but my first big goal was 50 lbs.</p>

  <p>I have been dancing around 50 lbs for two or three weeks now but could not seem to reach it. I even quit weighing myself for the last week or two but today I felt I had better check and low and behold 364.3 lbs. Sweet!!!</p>

  <h3><u>A visit to the bariatric surgeon</u></h3>

  <br>

  <p>I had had my 3 months visit with the bariatric surgeon this past Friday. She was very happy with my weight loss and we went over the results from my scope. She said everything was excellent with nothing found during the scope. No scaring from acid reflux. She took a biopsy looking for a specific bacterium that is sometimes found in the stomach but the results came back clean.</p>

  <p>We went over the results from the blood test 3 weeks earlier and she was happy with those numbers as well. The only numbers that were a little off were my triglycerides. I did some research on-line to see what I needed to do improve those numbers and it what I am already doing. Loose weight, exercise and eat healthy.</p>

  <p>She did recommend I speak with my PCP as my blood sugar was a little low and he may want to adjust the dosage. My A1C was exactly where it needed to be and all my tested vitamin levels were also where they were supposed to be.</p>

  <p>Over all she seemed to be very happy with my results so far. She told me that if I kept doing what I am doing, both before and after I have the surgery I would most definitely be a success story and get where I wanted weight wise.</p>

  <p>I am off work week after next so I will make an appointment with my PCP and see what he says about my medication.</p>

  <p>This will be the last time I see the bariatric surgeon until I complete all my visits with the dietitian. Then it will be for a last check up and to schedule the surgery.</p>

  <h3><u>Gym Etiquette</u></h3>
  <h3><u>Warning! Rant Incoming</u></h3>

  <br>

  <p>Society is built on rules. Like them or not they are there to give structure and to help keep the peace.
  It does not matter if it is the Ten Commandments, our nations laws, your company policies or the gym rules.
  They are all there to help a large group of people to work together without falling into chaos. You don’t have
  to like them or even agree with them but when you join any group, be it political, social, sport or any
  organization you can think of, you are introduced to and must agree to follow their rules.</p>

  <p>Gyms are the same way. I am a member of a large chain gym and they seem to be exactly what I need at this
  point in my journey to get fitter. One of the rules is that on the circuit machines do three reps and move on
  to the next machine. This will free up the machine for others to use. If everyone follows this simple rule every
  machine in that circuit will free up every few minutes. Doing this allows you to complete the full circuit in
  approximately 30 minutes. If you want to work on a certain area a little more, re-start your circuit.</p>

  <p>Yesterday I was at the gym and had completed my warm-up on the treadmill and went into the room where the
  circuit machines were located. There are 10 machines in the room and there were two women in there working out.
  One woman was on machine 2 and the other woman was on machine 9.</p>

  <p>No problem I thought, as I was going to start on the 1st machine and work my way around. I finished my three reps on the 1st machine and noticed that the woman was still on machine 2. I went to the cleaning station got some paper towels and disinfectant and cleaned the machine I just finished on. She was still going strong and at this point I counted 5 reps for her. So, realizing she had no intentions of leaving I skipped machines and went on to machine 3. As I was in the first rep the 1st woman got up and left. I finished what I was doing cleaned the machine and moved back to machine 2.</p>

  <p>This whole-time woman number 2 was still on machine 9. I didn’t give it much thought as I was several machines to go through before I even got there. As I worked on machine 4, woman number 1 came back into the room headed straight to machine 2 and was back at it.</p>

  <p>I worked my way through each machine and 20 minutes later as I got to machine 8, woman number 2 was still at on the same machine. So, I skipped her and did the last machine. I figured she had no intention of finishing any time soon so I head to lockers to get my stuff and head out. Showered, dressed and gym bag in hand I decide to take a quick walk past the circuit room and what do I see. The same 2 women on the same two machines.</p>

  <p>People the rules are there for a reason. They help make life work for everyone. Refusing to work within the rules makes life difficult for others and you look like an ass.</p>

  <p>OK. Rant complete. Soap box placed back in the closet until the next time it is needed.</p>

  <h3><u>Falling off the wagon</u></h3>

  <br>

  <p>You know how it is. When you first start anything, you are all gung ho about it. No matter if it is a new hobby, a new TV series or dieting. For the first few days or even weeks you are faithful but then something happens. You get distracted and miss a day at the gym. Your company has a shared day at work and gets pizza for everyone. For me it was getting sick
  for two weeks and not wanting to deal with an illness, dieting and the gym all at the same time. Have you seen those comic strips that makes fun of the macho man who can take anything until he gets a cold and then is all curled up in bed under a blanket crying because he doesn't want to get up? Well that's not me at all. Nope. No way.  OK,well maybe a little.</p>

  <p>When I get sick I don't want to fool with anything or anyone else. So, for the last two weeks I failed to stay on my diet, did not track any calories or liquid intake and sure as heck didn't go to the gym. So basically, I fell off the wagon.</p>

  <p>When things like this happen and they will. Don't let it get to you too badly. Realize what has happened, accept it and the get right back on your routine. If you do so quickly enough you most likely will not have put on much if any extra weight. You can then return to your routine with a new purpose. Don't look at it like a failure but more of a reset. We all need those now and again. A chance to step back and reflect what we have been doing and make any changes we feel necessary.</p>

  <p>Do not let a temporary failure set you back. If you let the
  negatives weigh you down you will never get anywhere and will constantly fail. It's like you used to hear as a kid when learning to ride a bike. If you fall, get up, brush yourself off and get back on.</p>

  <p>Two days ago, I restarted my diet and today I am down the
  two pounds I had put back on. I have my gym bag in the car and today after work, its straight to the gym. I fell down for a couple of weeks but this week I stood up brushed myself off and jumped right back on the wagon.</p>

  <h3><u>Breakfast Routine</u></h3>

  <br>

  <p>Thinking back, one of the first things I did when I started dieting was to change my breakfast routine. I am a creature of habit and every morning on the way to work at 4am I would swing by Whataburger and order a biscuit and gravy. I would joke with my friends and family that this is my redneck or hillbilly side showing through, but I have to admit I really miss my biscuits and gravy each morning. I have since switched that out with a protein drink.  <a href="http://amzn.to/2G5XN0c" target="_blank">Premier Protein</a> makes a drink that is 30 grams of protein while only 160 calories. I later learned that just one order of my biscuit and gravy contains 530 calories. Just think, some days I would order 2. That’s, 1060 calories just for breakfast. It is amazing how little we know until after the fact.</p>

  <P>There are multiple flavors with chocolate and banana being my favorite. Vanilla is OK with caramel being a little too cloying for my tastes. It has been 3 1/2 months so far and I am still drinking them. They are a little on the expensive side and hard for me to find. The only two places I have found them in my neighborhood is Walmart that only sells by the 4 pack and Tom Thumb Grocery which does sell them by the 12 pack but they only carry two flavors and it's $24.99 for the box.</p>

  <p>I spoke with a co-worker who is going through this right now and he told me Sam's has them at a much better price. After doing an internet search the nearest Sam's is 10 miles from my house and you need to purchase a membership. If my math is correct after buying 3-4 12 packs of Premier Protein I will make the money for the membership back in what I save on the price.</p>

  <h3><u>Fitbit</u></h3>

  <br>

  <p>Talking to people about the weight I am trying to loose and all the things I am doing, one of the questions I get asked frequently is, Is there any one thing that helps me the most to lose weight? After thinking about it the one best thing that comes to mind is the <a href="http://amzn.to/2DqEPjd" target="_blank">Fitbit</a>. It was recommended to me by a friend and when I looked into it. It seemed to be an excellent idea. It is a wearable device that looks like a watch. And what it does is that it tracks my steps for the day. For me most importantly it comes with a free app that lets me track calories, steps, water intake, exercise, macros, weight and many other things.
  </p>

  <p>The action of tracking these things makes sure I always know where I am at day-to-day in my progress. I feel that this one item has done more for me staying on top of my diet than anything else. Could I have done it without it? Sure, but  it has really made it much easier to keep up with everything I am trying to track.</p>

  <h3><u>Just a quick update</u></h3>

  <br>

  <p>I have my next appointment with the bariatric doctor this upcoming Friday. It will be my second office visit with her since I started this journey. I did see her when I had my scope done but that was only for a couple of minutes and she told me that unless there was an issue I would not see her when I awoke. Apparently she had multiple scopes scheduled for that day and she would be setting up for the next appointment while I was waking up.</p>

  <p>This past week has been a bad one for me. It seems that I may have caught that bug that has been going around. While I have not been feeling well all week, this past weekend it decided to hit me with a vengeance. Coughing, sneezing, runny nose and a raw throat. Because of this I have not been to the gym at all this week. I really need to get back to feeling well and going to the gym. My weight loss has stalled this week and I need to get back in the groove.</p>

  <h3><u>All caught up</u></h3>

  <br>

  <p>As of today, I am current on past entries in my journal. You may have noticed that before today the log entries had two or more dates listed. The first or top date is the date I typed this up. The other dates are the days it took place. I initially began keeping this in a written journal but due to the fact that people today spend more time typing that writing it was almost unreadable. So, I decided to transfer this over to PC as I can type much faster than I can write.</p>

  <p>This has been a bad week for me diet-wise. I am a stress or angry eater. If I get upset or am stressed out I want to eat and this week has been a bad one all around. I got on the scale this morning expecting to have put on a lot of weight after the way I have been eating but I am sitting at 370 lbs today. I was down to 368 so it was a gain of 2 lbs. I will live with it as I expected more after falling of the diet wagon but I am back on it today.</p>

  <p>Today is Friday so I will most likely work on getting some of the formatting fixed and post the website this weekend. This website will be a growing and evolving thing so do not be surprised if you visit and see changes both big and small.</p>

  <br>

  <p>(12/29/2017) I've not lost any more weight. Still sitting at 41 lbs. down. I did join a gym two weeks ago and have been working out. While I have not lost any weight, I have noticed my endurance has increased. I guess I will just have to keep on doing what I have and hope I get through this slump.</p>

  <p>2 months down and 4 more to go before I am approved for surgery.</p>

  <p>(01/02/2018) Happy New Year!!! As of today, I am at 371.6 lbs. This puts me at 44 lbs. down. I had stalled for several days but then got terribly sick over the weekend. I spent most of Saturday on the toilet. Well, that one way to lose weight.</p>

  <p>I made egg cups this weekend to add to my breakfast. At approximately 50 calories they should make a good addition to the mornings. (See the video recipes link above for the recipe if you are interested).</p>

  <p>I had a follow up with the dietitian today. This will mark the half way point of my journey to surgery. It was with a new dietitian. The lady that was seeing me had a baby over the holidays and was off on maternity leave. The new dietitian did not really cover much. She just took my weight and asked me how I was doing and if I had any questions. I did ask if she knew how to determine BMI? She said it was a formula and would give me a general number. She did the math but the numbers she came up with were higher that the numbers that came up during my physical assessment. So, I have decided to not worry about it right now and continue to focus on weight loss.</p>

  <p>(01/05/2018) I had an appointment today to get my lab work done. I had to wait until now as it was supposed to be scheduled two weeks before my next appointment with Dr. Malladi. I had a little trouble finding the place but that was all down on me not doing my due diligence in making sure I had all the information before I left for the appointment.</p>

  <p>I arrived a little early as I always do and was sitting in the waiting room for my turn when they called an elderly woman in ahead of me. As she went through the door I heard her ask the lady behind the counter if there was somewhere she could get a drink of water. The woman behind the counter rudely replied there was no water there for her. Before anything could be said by anyone else the head nurse came out and got on to her for speaking to anyone like that, much less an elderly woman. She tried to play it off as a lack of training but the nurse told her that was not a lack of training but a lack of respect.</p>

  <p>Anyway, they called me in a few minutes later and after drawing blood I was on my way home.</p>

  <br>

  <p>(11/30/2017) Reached another milestone today. As of this morning I am down 30 lbs. I weigh myself daily and I know you are not supposed to do this but I find it easier to stay on track. I have been up and down the same half pound for a week but today I hit 385.4 lbs. With my highest weight at 415 minus the 385 puts me at 30 lbs. gone. I will stop weighing myself daily soon I am sure but for now it seems to work for me.</p>

  <p>(12/04/2017) I am beginning to wonder if my scales are wrong. This morning I weighed in at 381.2 lbs. That is a 34 lbs. loss since I started my journey. While I hope it is true I am concerned that it may be incorrect. I do not know of another set that can weigh someone my size.</p>

  <p>(12/07/2017) I met with both the psychologist and the dietitian today. The Psych said he is very happy with my progress and my evaluation. He told me that he was submitting my evaluation back to Dr. Malladi with a firm approval. He said I had my head on straight and he wished more patients were more like me. It was a short visit but I we both seemed to be happy with the result.</p>

  <p>30 minutes after meeting the psychologist I saw the dietitian and as of today I am down 37 lbs. We talked about counting calories, increasing my steps for each day to 3000 and continuing to log everything. She also wants me to attempt the 30/30 rule. That’s no drinking 30 minutes before eating, no drinks during my meal and no drinking 30 minutes after my meal. Also, this visit showed me my scales are correct. As soon as I got home I weighed myself again and it matched the results at the dietitian’s office.</p>

  <p>(12/12/2017) I have been going back and forth with the same 1/2 lb. for the last 5 days. I was warned this would eventually happen. The quick weight loss would stop and then slow down to a crawl. It is still frustrating. I just have to keep doing what I am doing currently and I will eventually get past this.</p>

  <p>(12/18/2017) Yesterday was a big day for me. I hit the first big goal I set for myself. As of yesterday I am down 40 lbs. I weigh 375 lbs. down 40 lbs. from 415. I also joined a gym this weekend. Today after work will be my first visit.</p>

  <p>(12/20/2017) I saw something interesting this morning. It seems I have lost enough weight in my legs and feet that my ankles have decided to make an appearance.</p>

  <br>

  <p>(11/20/2017) It has been a little over a week but as of today I have dropped 26 lbs. overall so far. Got to love losing that water weight in the beginning of a diet. Quick loss on the scale but it is all water.</p>

  <p>The diet I have been following is averaging 1200-1300 calories. I am guessing that before this, I was consuming more than 3000 calories a day. That is a guess as I have never bothered to track it before.</p>

  <br>

  <p>The following week was really busy. I had to have a scope down my throat. They wanted to look for issues like any hernias. Two days later I had my first official visit with the dietitian and then the next day I had to go for a fitness evaluation.</p>

  <p>(11/07/2017) I arrived at the surgical center for the scope. It did not take long as I sat in the waiting area to be called less than 30 minutes. The nurse leads me to a prep-area with a bed. I had to undress and put on a surgical gown. (No one likes those things.) The nurse set me up on an IV then the anesthesiologist arrived to explain his part in the procedure and then a second nurse showed up and explained his part as well.</p>

  <p>After about 30 minutes I was rolled back into the room where they were going to do the actual scope and my bariatric surgeon was the one doing the scope. They got everything set up and I turned on my side and the anesthesiologist told me to start counting backward from ten. I was determined to see how long I could last. I remember 10, 9 & 8 and that was it.</p>

  <p>I woke up in the recovery area with a nurse watching over me and a sore throat that lasted a couple of days. Other than that, everything went fine. The doctor told me that if I did not hear from her then everything went fine and no issues were found. So, in this case it is an issue of no news is good news.</p>

  <p>I did learn one interesting fact in that anesthesia will remove the filter from your brain to your mouth. It seems I thought it was a good idea to hit on my nurse while waking up. I told her she was pretty and once I woke up enough to realize what I said I apologized. She just laughed it off and told me it was fine.</p>

  <p>On 11/09/2017 I had my first official one-on-one with the dietitian. She started off by weighing me and I was down 8 lbs. since I started dieting, so I was pretty stoked about that. She asked me questions about my activity levels and dietary habits. She wanted to know if I had any questions regarding the group meeting from the week prior. I really did not have much to ask but I did confirm that the protein shake was indeed a full meal replacement. So drinking them in place of breakfast was completely OK. Basically her advice was to drink water, start exercising and watching what I eat. I was disappointed in that she did not recommend any specific diet and really had no advice for me. She told me if I had any questions there were resources on the Internet she could point me to. Not really impressed as far as the dietitian was involved.</p>

  <p>On the next day 11/10/2017 I had an appointment at a gym for a fitness evaluation. That morning I replaced my breakfast with a protein shake. I had a snack mid-morning, lettuce wraps for lunch and two cheese sticks for an afternoon snack. I switched to decaf tea and let me tell you - it is disgusting. But, I am pretty sure I will learn to tolerate it. Eventually... I arrived for my fitness evaluation and a fitness trainer was working a small group through their exercises so I had a seat to wait my turn.</p>

  <p>Once done with his group he took me to a small office and asked me a few questions about my fitness level. He then took some measurements and had me hold a machine that would measure my BMI or body mass index. After that he had me walk the gym floor perimeter for 5 minutes and then let me go. Before I left he gave me a printed sheet that showed so examples of exercises, suggested I join a gym and that was it.</p>

  <p>So that was my week. It was kind of busy but glad I got it over with.</p>

  <h5>01/10/2018</h5>

  <br>

  <p>My next appointment was on 11/01/2017 with the bariatric clinic. It was a bariatric lifestyle class and was separate from the 6 required visits to the dietitian that insurance requires. I went and was one of two guys in the class and the rest were women. In at least two cases they were there for a second surgery as the first did not work for them. The dietitian giving the class handed out a package that included several samples and a book titled "Bariatric Surgery Handbook". The book touched on things like the different types of bariatric surgeries, the foods and drinks they recommend and food and drinks to stay away from.</p>

  <p>A lot of it is common sense but some of it was new information to me. Some example of the common sense information was giving up sodas and all sugary drinks. We also need to give up caffeinated drinks for the rest of our lives. Also, they recommend no alcohol going forward. The reason being is that the majority of the stomach will be removed and so any alcohol will make it to the intestines quicker causing faster absorption. Which is no issue for me as I do not drink anyway.</p>

  <p>Other things included in the book are like I said the types of procedures, a FAQ or frequently asked questions section. Nutrition basics, diet progression, the mind-body connection, exercise and common symptoms and side effects.</p>

  <p>One of the things the dietitian went over was some of the things we think are healthy but in reality, are not. Included in this are the majority of diet drinks, juices and diet bars. While they are marketed as healthy and or sugar free. Many of the ingredients included in them are anything but healthy. She pointed to a table in the back of the room and said anything we see on it should be avoided. On it were many common items like diet sodas, some juices, various energy bars, and several types of protein drinks marketed for the diet industry. I have to admit this part was an eye opener.</p>

  <p>After leaving the lifestyle class I thought it would be best if I went ahead and started on a diet. Even though I had been told by the bariatric surgeon I did not need to. I felt it would be for the best if I did. I did not want to have the surgery and have to start cold turkey as it were on a diet afterward. I started reading and looking up videos on You Tube to get ideas on what I needed to do.</p>

  <p>The first thing I did was cut out my morning stop at Whataburger and incorporate a meal replacement shake in the morning. I started with Premiere Protein and it seemed to have worked out really well for me.</p>

  <h5>01/08/2018</h5>

  <br>

  <p>In late September 2017 I went to the doctor for a routine visit and when the nurse weighed me I could not believe how big I had gotten. Talk about a slap in the face, but at 415 pounds this is the largest that I can remember ever being.</p>

  <p>Like many people before me, I decided right then to lose weight before I ended up dead from a heart attack or stroke. As I spoke with the doctor that day I broached the subject of weight loss surgery and what his opinion of it was. He was all for it and said he would setup an appointment with a bariatric surgeon he worked with. A couple of days later I received a call from Dr. Malladi's office to setup an appointment/consultation. When the day arrived I was part nervous and part excited to speak with her.</p>

  <p>My first appointment with Dr. Malladi was scheduled for 10/18/2017. The day of the appointment a member of her staff took me to a room to weigh me and to ask various questions. I am assuming that this would be similar to any other doctor visit. The nurse sees you for the administrative work and then the doctor will come in for the actual consultation. After being weighed and giving all the information regarding current medications and dosages, current and past medical history and any and all past attempts to lose weight and the results of those attempts, I was then lead to another room to wait for the doctor to see me.</p>

  <p>It was not long before the doctor walked in and introduced herself. She went over the information that was collected by the nurse earlier and then asked me what type of weight loss surgery I was considering. By this time I had read many articles and watched numerous videos on You-Tube and had narrowed it down to the sleeve. I told her my choice and asked her opinion as the professional. She told me that I had picked one of the two she would have recommended. The sleeve or bypass(RNY) were her top two choices. I asked about the lap band and she told me that she does not do them any longer as she saw a very low success rate. The only lap band patients she sees anymore were just for maintenance on existing patients.</p>

  <p>During my visit with the doctor we also went over insurance requirements. Apparently, my insurance requires a 6 month program where I have to see a dietitian 6 times (once per month), a physiologist once, get blood work done and have a scope down my throat into the stomach looking for issues like a hernia. I was lucky in that I did not have to lose any weight before the surgery as my height and current weight fell within allowed parameters. However, I was instructed not to put any weight on in the next 6 months.</p>

  <p>I left the bariatric doctor’s office with instructions not to gain weight and I would be receiving calls from the dietitian’s office, the physiologist’s office and the surgery center to schedule the scope. The blood work I would have to schedule myself but I was to wait until 2 weeks before my next visit with Dr. Malladi.</p>
